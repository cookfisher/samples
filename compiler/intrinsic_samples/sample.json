  "description": "The intrinsic samples are designed to show how to utilize the intrinsics supported by the  Intel\u00AE C++ compiler in a variety of applications. The intrinsic samples require processors that support Intel\u00AE MMX\u2122 and Intel\u00AE Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (Intel\u00AE SSE2) or higher. If not supported, the application will fail.",
