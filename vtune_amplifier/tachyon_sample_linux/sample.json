  "description": "The tachyon sample is a 2-D raytracer/renderer that shows how different types of Intel\u00AE VTune\u2122 Amplifier analysis help identify performance bottlenecks in the code, how algorithm optimization techniques affect the application performance, and how you can localize the performance changes you got after optimizations.",
